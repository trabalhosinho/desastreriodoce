      <h1>Rio Doce Disaster</h1>
      <hr>
      <h3>Can you be affected?<h3>
      <h6>If you live in Grande Vitória or Grande Belo Horizonte and you think you have not been affected by the Rio Doce disaster, you are mistaken. The river may not even pass through your city, but much of what you consume comes from cities close to it.</h6>
<h6>In Colatina, farmers continue to use the water from the river for irrigation; and although most of the plantations do not survive, what remains is marketed to the state of Espírito Santo. Most farmers do not even know that water is contaminated, and those who know it use it the same way by lack of alternative. And that same water that is used for agriculture is what people drink.
</h6>
<h6>The aquifers were also contaminated by the heavy metals contained in the "mud" (at levels well above that allowed by the Brazilian government), and the water withdrawn from it is used for consumption and agriculture in other more distant places, such as the south of Minas Gerais.</h6>
<h6>Now mud, debris and metals begin to dry through the cities and the dust begins to affect people directly. The blocks of dry mud were used to repaving streets, and trucks that pass up dust. People are completely uninformed and the government has not taken any major steps toward the disaster.</h6>
<h6>The metal will not leave the river by itself nor disappearing naturally, and while nobody does anything to change the situation people are becoming contaminated and will suffer greatly in the long run. One of the biggest disasters in Brazil occurred only one year and a half ago but almost no one talks about it. It's not like we could pretend That nothing happened and expect it to be arranged.</h6>
